In an autonomous robot, sensors help it understand the world and itself. The ultrasonic sensor is an active sensor because it sends out sound waves and measures how they bounce back. It is also an exteroceptive sensor since it gives the robot information about objects around it. The limit switch is a passive sensor because it only reacts when pressed, and it is also exteroceptive because it tells the robot when it touches something. Robots also use proprioceptive sensors to check things inside themselves, like battery level or motor speed. Using all these sensors together helps the robot move safely and make decisions.
