What is the actual physical process that is allowing the Raspberry Pi to sense the environmnet?

The sensors take things happening around them, like movement or distance, and turn them into electrical signals. The Raspberry Pi reads those signals and figures out what is going on in the environment by giving a high or low value response



What are some environmental factors that might influence the performance of these sensors?

The ultrasonic sensor can be affected if something blocks the sound waves or if the surface they hit does not reflect well. The limit switch can be influenced by debris making it not click fully, or if it is pressed too hard or not pressed at all.



What role does coding play in this process?

Coding tells the Raspberry Pi how to read the signals from the sensors and what to do with them. It makes the Pi understand when the limit switch is pressed or how far away something is using the ultrasonic sensor. Without coding, the Pi would not know how to use the information.
